# Loan Default Prediction Project

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://elena-bio-loan-default-prediction-ai-app-auf8cz.streamlit.app/)

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for predicting loan default risk using Python, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost. This repository demonstrates a full ML lifecycle, including data ingestion, cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and final prediction output.

## 🚀 Interactive Dashboard
I have deployed a live demo of this model using **Streamlit**. You can interact with the model, adjust features like Loan Amount, Asset Cost, and Age, and see the predicted risk probability in real-time.

## Project Overview

Loan default prediction is a key use-case in financial risk modeling. The goal of this project is to:
* [cite_start]Build a reliable ML pipeline that can run end-to-end in one script[cite: 37, 38].
* [cite_start]Produce cleaned data, EDA visualizations, engineered features, trained models, and a submission file[cite: 39].
* [cite_start]Compare multiple models and select the best one based on ROC-AUC[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]Demonstrate reproducible, professional ML workflow[cite: 41].

[cite_start]The entire pipeline is implemented in: `loan_pipeline_full.py`[cite: 42, 43].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The script automatically generates visualizations including:
* **Distribution Plots:** Loan Amount
* **Target Distribution** by Categories
* **Default rate** by Education
* **Proof submission count**

(plots available inside `/plots/`) [cite_start][cite: 85]

[cite_start]**Summary file:** `Elham_EDA_Report.md` [cite: 87]


* **Categorical Pipeline:**
    * Mode imputation
    * One-hot encoding with dynamic category expansion
 ## Feature Engineering

Features added:
* `loan_to_asset`
* `loan_amount_log`
* **Outlier flags** (column-wise binary indicators)
* Automatic selection of meaningful categorical features

**Output:** `model_ready_loan_data.csv`

## Preprocessing Pipeline

Using Scikit-Learn’s `ColumnTransformer`:

* **Numeric Pipeline:**
    * Median imputation
    * Standard scaling
* **Categorical Pipeline:**
    * Mode imputation
    * One-hot encoding with dynamic category expansion
 
## Model Training & Evaluation

**Models compared:**

| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | F1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LogisticRegression | 0.555 | **0.587** | 0.517 |
| RandomForest | 0.582 | 0.543 | 0.357 |

**Best Model Selected:** Logistic Regression (based on ROC-AUC).

**Evaluation Plots:**
* ROC curve comparison
* Feature Importance (RF)

## Final Model Training + Submission Generation

1. Best model is retrained on full dataset.
2. **Saved as:** `best_loan_model.joblib`
3. Test data processed + predictions created.
4. **Output file:** `submission.csv`

 ## How to Run

### 1. Run the Pipeline (Train Model)
To process data and train the model:
```bash
python loan_pipeline_full.py
```
